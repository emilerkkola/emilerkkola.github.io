<p>My name is Emil (Eemeli) Erkkola and I am a Masters of Physics graduate from University of Warwick 2017. I am very interested in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, computer vision, data scraping, data processing and web design. </p>

<p>I am currently working in Europeâ€™s biggest fintech company as a data analyst, whilst working on machine learning projects in my time outside of work. The current project I am working on is titled Label and Learn, a useful tweet classifier for the cryptocurrency Ethereum, which I aim to use to predict Ethereum price using sentiment analysis as one of the main indicators. </p>
