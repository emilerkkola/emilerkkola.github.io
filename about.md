<p>My name is Emil and I am a Masters of Physics graduate from University of Warwick 2017. I am very interested in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning, natural language processing, topic modelling, cloud computation and quantum computing. I like to build and prototype models using powerful EC2 instances with Python.</p>

<p>I am currently working as a Data Scientist at a news company, specialising in training state-of-the-art NLP models using a self-built cloud backend. I love to work on machine learning projects in my time outside of work, and I am addicted to improving my skills through competitions on Kaggle. Machine learning (especially deep learning) is my greatest passion, and I am constantly doing online lecture series and MOOCs to improve my skills. I am currently going through Jeremy Howard's Fast.ai course, whilst participating in Kaggle competitions and studying to pass Associate level certifications on Amazon Web Services. </p>
